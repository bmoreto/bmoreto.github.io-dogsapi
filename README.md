# 🔗 WordPress REST API Project

This project was developed during the **WordPress REST API Course** by [Origamid](https://www.origamid.com/).  
The course focuses on learning how to use and customize the **WordPress REST API** for integration with front-end applications — specifically for the **Complete React Course** project.

## 🚀 About the Course

The main goal of this course is to teach how to **create custom and specific endpoints** in WordPress, extending the default REST API functionalities to meet real project requirements.

Throughout the lessons, I learned how to interact with WordPress as a headless CMS and how to build tailored API routes for a modern front-end environment.
